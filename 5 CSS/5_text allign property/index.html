    <h1>Marble </h1>
        <p>Marble is a rock resulting from metamorphism of
             sedimentary carbonate rocks, most commonly limestone 
             or dolomite (rock). Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization 
             of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock 
             is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate crystals. 
             Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock 
             (protolith) have typically been modified or destroyed.

            Pure white marble is the result of metamorphism of a very pure (silicate-poor) 
            limestone or dolomite protolith. The characteristic swirls and veins of many colored 
            marble varieties are usually due to various mineral impurities such as clay, silt, sand,
             iron oxides, or chert which were originally present as grains or layers in the limestone
             . Green coloration is often due to serpentine resulting from originally magnesium-rich
              limestone or dolomite with silica impurities. These various impurities have been mobilized
               and recrystallized by the intense pressure and heat of the metamorphism.[citation needed]

    <p>Marble is a rock resulting from metamorphism of
        sedimentary carbonate rocks, most commonly limestone 
        or dolomite (rock). Metamorphism causes variable recrystallization 
        of the original carbonate mineral grains. The resulting marble rock 
        is typically composed of an interlocking mosaic of carbonate crystals. 
        Primary sedimentary textures and structures of the original carbonate rock 
        (protolith) have typically been modified or destroyed.
